This book represents decades of research into automated sound design
techniques and their compositional applications. Despite the familiar
topics, I believe that readers will find a different approach to sound
design than they may be familiar with. Once the central concept of the
book has been grasped, and the necessary skills acquired, there are
endless other sound design techniques that could be treated similarly.
As I suggest in the Afterword, these techniques might also lend
themselves to machine learning approaches, an idea that I look forward
to investigating in the next phase of this research.

For those of you who just want to make some cool sounds, the software
found within this supplement may provide you with a few new tools and ideas.
