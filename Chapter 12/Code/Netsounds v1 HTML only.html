<h1>
  Spatialized Web-sourced Sounds
    </h1>
    This page loads four randomly selected sounds from the Web. Sources are from Freesound.org and a few of my computer music outtakes
    from the 1990s. Some of the longer sounds may take a few moments to load. 
    <p></p>
    To get this going, press the "Play Soundfile" buttons for all four
    sounds. Once active, you will have control of the playback speed and gain for each soundfile. Each soundfile is randomly located in 3D space.
    Press the "Randomize Sound Locations" button at the bottom to generate new spatial configurations. You can manually position each sound using the
    X,Y, and Z sliders. You can manipulate the
    Listener positions X,Y, and Z sliders to navigate through the 3D spatial constellation of the four sounds.
    For a new set of sounds, simply reload the web page.
    <p>

    In case you would like to contribute a sound to the random selection library, 
    please <a href="mailto:audiodidact@gmail.com">email</a> me or DM me a link on 
    <a href = "https://www.facebook.com/Eric.Lyon.composer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook</a>. 
    Criteria are: MP3 format, two minutes or less in duration, persistently available on the Web, the sound is yours to share, and
    is family friendly.
